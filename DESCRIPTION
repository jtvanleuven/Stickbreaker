Description: Genetically modified organisms are used to test the phenotypic effects of
   mutation. Often, multiple substitutions impact organismal fitness differently than
   single substitutions (epistatic interactions). This package fits three basic models
   (additive, multiplicative, and stickbreaking) to fitness data and suggests the best
   fitting model by multinomial regression. Stickbreaker can also be used to simulate
   fitness data.
